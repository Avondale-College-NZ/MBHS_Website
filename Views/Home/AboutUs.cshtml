                The story of Marist Brothers' High School is one of dedication, vision, and commitment to educational excellence. Founded by the Marist Brothers, a Catholic religious order renowned for their contributions to education worldwide, our school began with a modest yet profound mission: to provide quality education grounded in faith, compassion, and academic rigor.

                Over the years, our institution has grown and evolved, adapting to the changing needs of our students and society while staying true to our founding principles. From our humble beginnings, we have emerged as a beacon of academic excellence and moral integrity in Fiji, shaping generations of leaders, scholars, and compassionate individuals.
